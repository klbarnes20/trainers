## Agenda:
### Introductions
### Pre and post workshop discussion
Zac: 
- Midway through a workshop with and audience of (mostly) librarians in California. teaching the four-half-days version. Did their first teaching session yesterday, second coming up today. Need to cut down on the number of stories I tell, but going well on the whole. This is my second workshop in this format. Four-day format allows a little more flexibility, though I would prefer a slightly later start. Feels like the community building is more effective over four days. The timing isn't quite down yet, so I haven't necessarily been picking the best exercises to do and might have to skip some content.
- Have you rearranged content?
- Yes, content was rearranged both times I did this so far. first time, checkout process covered on day three. For both, we split up the content so we could break up the teaching demos across three of the four days. I think this reinforces the building of teaching skill across the duration of the workshop.
- Could you open an issue to discuss this on intructor training repo? yes

### Announcements
- Participation data is coming! Emails going out next week.
- Automated email reporting some numbers about your participation
- Would love feedback: what kind of data would be interesting to you? what kind(s) of aggregation?
- Planned for some time next week.
- Won't include demos this time but that's also planned for the future
- Status updates October 13-23
- Encouraging people to review the trainer agreement again and consider those commitments alongside others you may have within The Carpentries. 
- You can then tell us whether you want to commit again to being a Trainer for the next year.
- Aligning expectations.
- Going to the email address we have for you in AMY, *not* to the Trainers TopicBox list. Hope to avoid your  spam filters but please look out for these messages.
- We just announced Carpentries Philanthropy! We encourage Trainers to join the list (low traffic) and share with your communities: https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/10/introducing-the-carpentries-philanthropy/
- A place to share impact of donations on our projects
- Running a fundraising campaign for the first time
- Please share!

### Topic of the month
- https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/pull/1176
- This PR adjust language and details of checkout process with the aim of providing clearer guidance on what is valid for the lesson contribution part of checkout. Also a couple of other things in there. Idea being that we state which lesson repositories are valid for the contribution part of checkout and also mention the Glossario repository which is a glossary of terms we are also encouraging trainees to contribute to. Brought about for me by wanting to publicize new Help Wanted Issues page which is ready for public consumption, and we want to encourage people who are ready to make the lesson contribution to go to that page, with the hope that they'll use their contribution to fix those issues.
- Main conflict (Toby thinks!) is that this list is different from the list of lessons ok to teach from in the demos. Is this a problem?
- Maneesha: List of curated lessons to try out live coding ok to be different from contribution list. - We do need to be more clear about the purpose of lesson contributions. If we are directing them to a curated list of good places to leave their contribution, we should be clear about why. We have generally said you can contribute to any of our repos, lesson or not. So some guidance on is my PR going to be better here vs elsewhere, or something that assures them that they can still contribute elsewhere if they prefer. Help wanted page has tags, Good First Issue tags should be featured prominently.
- Toby: we hope that help wanted page will help ensure that maintainers respond. Will talk to Francois about tagging.
- Alex: inevitable that these two lists will diverge. We want to teach well established lessons, and we need contributions in developing lessons. It will help them to understand the current stage of development in other lessons. 
- In Preparing to Teach episode (i.e. during Instructor Training),  we ask the trainees to pick any lesson to teahc from, but narrow down that list for the teaching demo. Should we align the two lists? What thoughts do people have about difference between these two?
- Kari: are Trainers finding that what trainees are preparing to teach isn't aligning? I usually find that I pick a spot for trainees to start their demo, which they've already been practicing. 
- Karen: to clarify, I'm talking about what they preapre to teach during Instructor Training workshop.
- Zac: One thing we talked about in current workshop is that some of our audience don't feel confident about teaching R or Python, and this can limit their options for the teaching demo. I also recently got a batch of trainees using spreadsheets lesson for demo and I found it really tough to pick out enough places involving live coding/demo to work, especially with multiple trainees using the lesson in the same demo session.
- Kelly: I was pretty new to a lot of the tools we teach with when I took Instructor Training, so I chose to teach from early in R lesson during workshop, then spreadsheets for demo because I was afraid of being asked to teach material later in the lesson for the demo. Good to have that option for those who are less confident on command line tools.
- Karen: I don't think we have any answers yet but I'm glad we started the conversation. Mainatiners will continue to discuss and we'll see what comes out of the second meeting today.
- Bumping the message about teaching the bonus modules. There has been high demand for these and we would love to hear from you if you are interested in teaching these. This first one is about teaching online, next topic on the list is about equity, inclusion, and accessibility. We're asking for only one trainer in the teaching team, the second person can be an instructor or a trainer - good for a self-organised session.
- Aleks: are you covered for the 15th?
- Karen: 15th will be an onboarding session for trainers I am running. You may have signed up as an attendee. Taught sessions will be after that - Contact us if you want to teach on these.

***Agenda:***
### Introductions
###Pre and post workshop discussion
- Brian & Darya 8 x 1.5 hours, cohort of 12 of whom 11 completed. 1 dropped out due to internet connectivity. people missed one or 2 sessions, used peer learning at the end to get them caught up. 50/50 different parts of AUS and everywhere else. 1 Japan 1 central europe 1 US 1 India (lost). Harder for us to do because we wanted to connect them and couldn't really. Other challenge was that it was a crazy time for one of them (4:30AM?!) 
- Distributed sessions, schedule mostly worked. Would change a few things but mostly worked. Opportunity for homework and reflective practice was great. Concept map as homework vs pressure to produce on the spot worked really well, indicated they appreciated that. Did make sure that we spent the time allocated in the schedule to actually reflect on them [flipped!]. Explicity spent first 10 minutes going over feedback and addressing points of confusion etc. Modeled response to feedback multiple times. Lots of feedback, lots of tweaking. Love the fact that we got this in bite size chunks with reflection etc. Wrote quite a lot on the final 'put it together' activity so really did get quite a lot out of it. Could stretch it out even more. Loved make-up session so that they could miss one, especially people with kids. 
- Brian: Session should be 2 hours for spin up and spin down. 5 minute breaks, too short. 2 days a week for 4 weeks. Double week meant long break and short break, closely spaced repitition vs meaningful homework. Wish other people would do the timing granularity we did, tracked start and stop to the minute to get a sense of how long they actually take, rather than optimistic timings in lessons. LIve coding in pairs of 2 and ended early. They had prepped, went fast. did triads instead next. Feedback cycle 'was the pedagogy' -- really demonstrated meaningfully. Biggest downside - we spent a lot more time preparing than we would a 2-day, doesn't feel like a lot until it's an hour or 2 times 8. Darya: doesn't feel as onerous though because you're not doing so much at once. You can do more prep, added lots of slides, really put more effort into it.
- Git homework was as usual hopeless. Don't set expectations for technical knowledge, fell apart, would have fallen apart later. Not clear how much this helps them anyway.
- Someone attended a community call and shared how much they liked it at the next meeting. 
- They bonded with each other, not clear how much Trainers connected with trainees. Felt less connected online vs in person maybe. Hopping in and out of breakouts is not circulating.

- Actual timings: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XPTZM6HPbpWKdVCw7KWNTo6ePhAQmoucon9vI6Y8COU/edit?usp=sharing
- How did you identify local groups? Searched from Discuss, looked through slack, trolled internet records and found the connection then emailed. European participant already was connected. US trainee had local groups as well. India most challenging. a) alone in unit & city, teaching environment does not favor peer feedback so how to help others when she goes to teach with them is a little more nuanced. Don't want to damage careers. 
- One thing re: homework -- we needed to do expectation setting each week about what they needed to prep. There was some issue with us having them prep too early and then they "forgot" their episode they prepared.
- We also had a lot of observers from the local aussie trainers community, being better about telling people about these online opportunities to observe/refresh knowledge could be a useful communication.
- Ariel: 4 half day online session librarians mostly in California. 9-4 x 4 days, same schedule as taught with Tim recently. Really positive feedback on the last one, 'best online training we've ever done' -- still found 4 hours to be pretty tiring. Done for the day afterward, don't want to do a full day. Have signed up for one, but 4 half days was really nice. Agree you have a chance to incorporate more feedback, pivot, discuss. Preparation you can break up homework to have a little bit each day.Everything else pretty much the same, submitted PR asking about introducing the rubric for demos, whether we hould do that earlier for the 4 day format it came pretty late. 2 10 minute breaks each time.
- Tim: it was not easier doing 4 days in a row. It's a marathon.
- Brian: could be effective at work after 1/4 day workshops. Half day, no, worthless in the afternoon. Worked fine. Substantitve difference between 1/2 and 1/4 day.

### Topic of the month
- [Small topic proposal? - Darya] When do we share workshop pages with learners in workshops? (policy/recommendations online vs in-person + instructor training incorporation?)
- During a workshop, I'm teaching: I tend to only share it at the end, and when people have it at the beginning, if it's distracting i try to gently convice them to trust in the participatory live coding. In instructor training: it usually comes up in the preparing to teach episode as a question 
- I make a point of "don't show the lessons on the screen" during workshop prep with my co-instructors that we shouldn't show notes, but it's complicated by some of the Jupyter notebooks we've prepared. 
- One common error in non-badged instructors is that they teach from the lesson directly. I don't think we spend enough time on how to get our badged instructors to norm-set for their co-instructors. 
- During a workshop, online, I shared the lesson and had a code-log in our shared document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O3w7aVw8QGd4ZyFzvr8tP0eaTGFMlquImPenWQBhtTc/edit to allow people to catch up and recover from zoom drops, but I'd never allow something like this in person. Constraints are very different online in terms of attention and recoverability and helper-side-channeling. 
 
- I tell them at the end of a workshop unless I need someone is very far behind and give them a rapid jump to the current content
- When I teach a workshop I don't live code with the notes up, but what I do is pull up the notes before we start to show people where we are so they can follow along. As I move though the material, I will put links into a google doc/etherpad saying where we currently are. Sometimes I will want to pull up the material to talk about a  diagram. RE: teaching demos, I haven't had someone show notes yet when live coding 

- I generally start a workshop by giving people a heads up that all the materials are online so they don't need to take detailed notes, then put links in the etherpad, and then remind folks at the end and send them out in the post workshop email.
- In a recent demo two out of five didi show the notes, but I let them go on as they didn't read them or copy-paste, but I we discussed this during feedback
- Sometimes people in workshops actually want to see notes side-by-side and say the feel lost or confused while watching live coding and trying to check where in the materials we are (and we spend some time justifying the live coding setup and emphasise that we wuill have copy of the notes on therepad and the materials are available for self study after the workshop)

Use of lessons in demos: 
- Subsetting the lessons ( as we currently do somewhat) is really unfair.
- Having to prepare the whole lesson may not be accomplishing the objective. 
- Some people will overprepare if we give them only one lesson to prepare

- Could we make files that help avoid the setup /dependency issues?  for openrefine we could have a set of files that during the demo we point people to the partially processed one.  for git, we could have a repo with history that tthey clone & then teach from 
- We should also experiment with the "start in the middle" teaching demo+1

- Could we ask people to prep for live-coding intensive sections from two lessons instead of one and clearly label those eposides not to prep for? There is variatin in the amount of live coding people do based on the selected lessons.
